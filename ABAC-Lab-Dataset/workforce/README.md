# Policy Description: Workforce

*Vesion: v20250308*

This policy governs a SaaS workforce management application provided by eWorkforce, which facilitates workflow planning and supply management for service appointments like installations and repairs.

Tenants (eWorkforce customers) create tasks for their customers, which are assigned to technicians working for eWorkforce, its workforce suppliers, or their subcontractors. Work orders are scheduled as needed, and warehouse operators handle supply requests.

The policy defines access rules for eWorkforce employees and specific tenants, such as PowerProtection (a power protection service provider) and TelCo (a telecommunications provider). Permissions to view, assign, and complete tasks depend on factors such as the user’s role, task assignments, managerial supervision, and contract associations within eWorkforce.

This policy is available as a case study in *Decat et al. (2014)*, which provides further details.
